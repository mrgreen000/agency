## Development Environment
- Use Vite for development server: `npm run dev`
- user port number: 5177
- Development URL: http://localhost:PORT
- Always test changes in browser during development

## Automatic Server Management
- ALWAYS run `npm run dev` after making any file changes
- Don't just make changes and stop - start the server to test them
- If the server is already running, kill and restart it
- Report the server status and any startup errors

## Project Context
- Read project.md for requirements and specifications
- Follow setup instructions in README.md for initial installation

## Development Workflow
- Start dev server before making frontend changes
- Ensure hot reload is working
- Test all changes locally before committing
